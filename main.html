	  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. It helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example is O(n), which means the memory required grows linearly with the input size.
